            We envision a world without displacement, where land is returned to
            indigenous stewardship, and land is not treated as a commodity. We
            will never be able to fill all the needs of our community members
            facing evictions and displacement. We know that real change will
            come through the abolishment of our current capitalist system that
            values profits and property rights over people. However, short of
            that, people have immediate needs and if you have the resources and
            wish to help then you can contribute to the Mutual Aid fund.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Mutual Aid fund provides resources to these tenants who are
            facing displacement and the consequences of eviction. Ways these
            funds will and have been used:

            <strong>You are here because you want to contribute</strong> and you
            believe in a more just and caring SF where all tenants, regardless
            of income and background can live and thrive in their communities.
            Use this form to figure out how much of your resources you should
            contribute to mutual aid each year and per month. This tool takes in
            several factors; access to generational wealth, your yearly net
            income, and your relationship to San Francisco, and comes up with a
            suggested donation. What you input into this form will remain
            confidential, and will not be used for any other purpose. This is
            simply a tool to help calculate how much you should be giving to
            mutual aid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Included in this tool is how much you should be paying in Land Tax
            each month and per year to the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the
            original stewards of this land. We highly encourage you to donate to
            our mutual aid fund and pay your land tax, especially as we are
            organizing on stolen, unceded Ohlone territory.
