          <h3>Mutual Aid Fund - ongoing</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a world without displacement, where land is returned to
            indigenous stewardship, and land is not treated as a commodity. We
            will never be able to fill all the needs of our community members
            facing evictions and displacement. We know that real change will
            come through the abolishment of our current capitalist system that
            values profits and property rights over people. However, short of
            that, people have immediate needs and if you have the resources and
            wish to help then you can contribute to the Mutual Aid fund.
          </p>

          The Mutual Aid fund provides resources to these tenants who are facing
          displacement and the consequences of eviction. Ways these funds will
          and have been used:

          <ul>
            <li>Support legal costs of fighting evictions in court</li>
            <li>Material support for living expenses for tenants</li>
            <li>
              Moving expenses for those who have been evicted from their home
            </li>
            <li>Medical expenses</li>
            <li>Relocation funds</li>
            <li>Groceries + basic living necessities</li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          <h3>Stay Hearings - ongoing</h3>
          <p>
            When a tenant receives a Sheriff’s notice, it means they have lost
            an Unlawful Detainer case. Tenants can get a Sheriff’s notice as
            quick as 2 weeks after the court decides a landlord wins. The next
            thing a tenant receives is a one week Sheriff’s Notice on their
            door, usually on a Wednesday. After that, the tenant can ask the
            court to pause the eviction for one week at a time. On top of this,
            they need to pay 1 week's worth of rent. Our goal in attending is to
            provide support to the tenants and accountability to the judges and
            landlord attorneys.
          </p>
          <h3>Denhi Donis - ongoing</h3>
          <p>
            The Flower Lady of Bernal Heights, also facing an Ellis Act eviction
            from the home she lived in for over a decade. A survivor of domestic
            violence, survivor of cancer, an indigenous woman, single mother,
            Denhi Donis is famous in SF for giving and selling flowers at events
            across SF. Her name in Mayan means flower, her acts are an homage to
            her mom, the person that named her. As she battled the eviction
            case, she needed to schedule a few life-saving surgeries, and
            couldn’t schedule it because her housing situation was unstable. She
            needed at least a year to be able to have the surgery, heal, and
            find a new home. Denhi touched the hearts of all of us as an elder,
            a maternal figure. Her eviction really inspired the growth of our
            Mutual Aid Committee Our Mutual Aid Committee organized a fundraiser
            at Medicine for Nightmares in honor of Denhi. She agreed to a move
            out agreement for a year. Landlords continue harassment, ERN has
            made out calls to be there with her.

          <h3>3661 19th Street - ongoing</h3>
          <p>
            The 12-unit building at 3661 19th Street includes a mix of senior,
            LGBTQ, Asian American, and working class tenants who have lived in
            their homes an average of nearly 20 years. Their home was bought by
            speculators who were evicting them via the Ellis Act. The tenants
            were already united when we got in touch with them around winter of
            2021. They had been battling an eviction since 2018, and this was
            the second time they were trying. We helped them carry out phone
            zaps to the speculators and MOHCD. We did an email launch of Ryan
            Fong’s company, emailing all of his coworkers that he was an evictor
            in SF. Unfortunately, the company blocked most of our emails, but
            they successfully were delivered to the people at the top of the
            company. Each tenant brings so much to the organizing, from
            leadership to sleuthing skills. As their case inched closer and
            closer to trial, MOHCD agreed to let MEDA buy their building. After
            an appraisal, the negotiations reopened in November of 2022 and we
            were activated once again. We launched another phone zap of MOHCD.

          <h3>Eviction Defense Trainings</h3>
          <p>
            We wanted to create a
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fY8cgeD6PkOqjPdGWxQtXE7lWwRi-6-RMk2Kfz776Vk/edit'"
              target="_blank"
              >training</a
            >
            for people to prepare for the kinds of actions we would plan.
            Whether you have never been to an action before, or experienced with
            blockading the Sheriff, this training centers all of us. Answers
            general “what if '' questions. We discuss some history around
            eviction defense work in SF.
          </p>
          <h3>Shawana Holmes</h3>
          <p>
            In collaboration with HRC, we planned for a Sheriff’s blockade. We
            launched a phone zap against the Executive Director of TNDC,
            demanded they stop the eviction, and give Shawanna and her family a
            bigger home to live in. They called off the Sheriff. Unknown if she
            was moved into a bigger unit.
          </p>
          <h3>Alex and Rose</h3>
          <p>
            Our first “use” of the ERN! Alex has advanced stage ALS, and cannot
            easily leave his home, he needs an electric stair climber to do so.
            Legally, a landlord doesn’t have to pay for this, but they do have
            to let the tenants pay for accommodations like this. However, this
            landlord wasn’t allowing them to do so and was harassing them
            because of their rent control. The landlord was threatening to take
            away the one hand rail they had, so Alex and Rose called the ERN for
            any kind of support. We sent out a call to our organizers and folks
            that lived near them. Since this was the height of COVID, we stood
            outside and just observed. The landlord ended up installing a new
            handrail.
